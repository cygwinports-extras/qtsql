ldesc: "The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, generic GUI 
database browsing frontend. The tool is a very simple aggregation of the 
Qt database classes. The database abstraction is provided by the Qt 
database drivers. So far, the drivers for PostgreSQL and MySQL have been 
found to work well."
